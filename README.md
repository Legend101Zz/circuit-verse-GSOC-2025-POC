# Open Hardware Component Library: CircuitVerse Extension Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains my proposal and initial prototypes for extending **CircuitVerse** by introducing a broader set of advanced hardware components—especially shift registers and sequential circuits. The main goal is to strengthen the bridge between simulation and real-world hardware concepts, making CircuitVerse even more effective as a tool for learning digital electronics.

## Why This Matters

CircuitVerse is an incredible platform for visualizing and experimenting with digital circuits. That said, its component library currently misses some crucial elements—like shift registers and counters—that are core to understanding real-world hardware systems. This project aims to fill that gap by:

1. Adding widely-used components like SISO, SIPO, PIPO, and universal shift registers.
2. Laying the groundwork for future support for hardware-level behavior and integration.

## What You’ll Find in This Repository

The repo is organized to give a clear picture of both the research and the implementation process:

- **`docs/`**: Technical deep dives

  - `simulator-overview.md`: Overview of how the simulator works under the hood
  - `adding-elements.md`: Step-by-step guide to building new components
  - `implementation-details.md`: Specifics of how each shift register was built

- **`images/`**: Diagrams and screenshots used in documentation

- **`implementations/`**: Working prototypes

  - Includes SISO, SIPO, PISO, PIPO, bidirectional and universal shift registers
  - Ring Counter and LFSR also implemented as advanced use cases

- **`suggestions/`**: Future features and ideas
  - A “Component Explorer” for students to peek inside how components work
  - A drag-and-drop Visual Component Creator—no coding required!

## How I Approached This

The project was broken down into three key phases:

### 1. Understanding CircuitVerse Internals

I started with a deep dive into CircuitVerse’s simulator to understand:

- How components are structured and added
- How the simulation engine processes signals
- How visual rendering and interactivity are handled
- Where and how to plug in new elements

This gave me a solid understanding of how modular and extensible the platform already is, with components building off a shared `CircuitElement` base and defining their behavior, visuals, and serialization logic.

### 2. Building the Core Components

With that knowledge, I implemented several proof-of-concept components:

#### Shift Registers:

- **SISO (Serial In, Serial Out)**
- **SIPO (Serial In, Parallel Out)**
- **PISO (Parallel In, Serial Out)**
- **PIPO (Parallel In, Parallel Out)**
- **Bidirectional Shift Register**
- **Universal Shift Register** — handles all modes of operation

#### Advanced Counters:

- **Ring Counter**
- **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** — generates pseudo-random sequences

Each one is functional within CircuitVerse’s simulation environment and adheres to its rendering and interaction standards.

### 3. Looking Ahead — Enhancement Ideas

Once the components were up and running, I explored ways to make CircuitVerse even more interactive and beginner-friendly:

#### Component Explorer

An educational tool that lets users “open up” existing components to see how they’re built and understand their logic—like an IDE for circuit elements.

#### Visual Component Creator

A no-code tool that lets anyone create custom components by connecting blocks and defining behavior without writing a single line of JavaScript.

## What’s Next?

If selected, my plan is to:

1. Finalize, test, and polish all components
2. Write in-depth documentation and tutorials for students and educators
3. Design intuitive icons and UI for each component
4. Begin development on the enhancement tools

These additions will make CircuitVerse a richer and more powerful platform—especially for students transitioning from simulation to real-world digital systems.
